                    Just build it. Simple enough idea and I don't think most programmers, including myself, practice it enough.
                    We're often too concerned with trying to build something as if it was suddenly going to have millions of concurrent
                    users that we never end up building anything. So from now on when I think "how would you do that?" - I'm going to <em>try</em>
                    do it. The goal is not to pick something that is going to take weeks of constant work, I have a full time job and shit, but stuff
                    that takes an hour, 2 hours maybe more if I am enjoying it but the point is to just <em>write more code</em>. You get better at the
                    things you do most often
                </p>

                    So for the first post in what will hopefully become a series I am doing one of the most clich√© starter apps: A tip calculator. In javascript.
                    Why ?

                <ul>
                    <li>It's simple</li>
                    <li>It's quick</li>
                    <li>I don't use JS in my day job so the first 2 points are useful</li>
                </ul>

                    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> the code you are going to find in these posts is never going to be optimal, that just isn't the point. Unless you plan
                    on shipping this to customers don't feel the need to add in all the exception handling, it will just put you off doing it. Now I'm not saying you 
                    should never learn to handle exceptions, I'm just saying don't let the thought of corner cases stop you pumping out some logic

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    You've had dinner in a nice restaurant and there is a big party of you at the table. The bill comes and you look at each other 
                    and need to figure out 2 things. How much do we tip the server and how much do we each have to pay after that is added to the bill ?<br/>
                    We have 4 variables:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The total bill</li>
                    <li>How much we want to tip</li>
                    <li>The number of people</li>
                    <li>How much we have to pay including the tip</li>
                </ul>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-kotlin">
                    class CounterViewModel : ViewModel() {

                        var count = 0
                    
                        fun getIncrementedCount(): Int{
                            this.count ++
                            return this.count
                        }
                    }
